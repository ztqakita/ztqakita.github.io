## Abstract
They trained single network models to perform **20 cognitive tasks** that depend on working memory, decision making, categorization, and inhibitory control.
- **What they find:**
  - recurrent units can develop into clusters that are functionally specialized for different cognitive processes
  - **compositionality of task representations**: one task can be performed by recombining instructions for other tasks.
