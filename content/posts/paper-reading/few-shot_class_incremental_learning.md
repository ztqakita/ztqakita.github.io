## Abstract
- ***FSCIL***: It requires CNN models to incrementally learn new
classes from **very few labelled samples**, without forgetting the previously learned ones.
- ***TOPIC***: Topology-preserving knowledge incrementer framework, which is proposed to **mitigates the forgetting of the old classes** by stabilizing NGâ€™s topology and improves the representation learning for few-shot new classes by growing and adapting NG to new training samples.

## Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning
- Task Design
  - a stream of training sets $D^{(1)}, D^{(2)}, \dots$, and for each training set $D^{(t)}$, $L^{(t)}$ is the set of classes of $D^{(t)}$.
