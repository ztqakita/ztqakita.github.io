# I. A mathematical model of a neuron
- Equivalent circuit model  
![](/images/posts/NC/1.JPG)

- Parts of the circuit:
  - Power supplies: multiple to power different parts of the circuit to do different things
  - Integartor(积分器) of past inputs
  - Temporal filter to smooth inputs in time
  - Spike generator: the sodium current(钠通路) and potassium current(钾通路) make a spike generator that generates an action potential and then talks to another neurons.
  - Oscillator(振荡器)

- The wires of brain: The intracellular and extracelluar sapce is filled with salt solution.(细胞内液和细胞外溶液的电流)
